# MyFavTrip
This is a website for Sydney public transport similar to Google Maps and TripView, 
where you can enter where you're starting from and where you want to go, 
with departure/arrival times and it will show you a trip. 
You can save this trip in "Favourites", and access it easily later. 

# Usage
You can access and use this website at http://edwudw.me/

This GitHub repository contains the source files.
